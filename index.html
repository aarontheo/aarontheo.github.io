        I am very excited to learn more about web design and development!
        I also just got engaged, so I'm pretty jazzed about that. 
        I'm a computer scientist studying at BYU-Idaho, 
        and I love how friendly all the teachers are.

    <p>I'm a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, 
        and my favorite scripture is Moroni 10:32:</p>
    <p>
        "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in Him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind, and strength, then is His grace sufficient for you, that by His grace ye may be perfect in Christ..."
